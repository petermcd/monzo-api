Reporting a Vulnerability
-------------------------------------

Although this package is intended for locally hosted applications, fixing
security vulnerabilities is still important, especially when finance is
involved.

In the event such an issue has been identified please open a
`Github Issue <https://github.com/petermcd/monzo-api/issues>`_
information required.

For more sensitive information, for example exploitation details should be
emailed to git@petermcdonald.co.uk.

Although every effort will be made to resolve an issue in a timely manner
please allow the standard 90 days to resolve such issues. Once an issue
has been resolved a 7-day grace period should be allowed so that
users have a chance to update.
